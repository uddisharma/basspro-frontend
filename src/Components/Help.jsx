              Restaurants create attractive deals within Basspro, which you can
              obtain coupons for. Our coupons differ from other conventional
              deal sites in that you <b>do not need</b> to make any upfront
              payment at KindMeal, and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via
              computer, mobile or laptop without any print coupons. For
              restaurants that do not require advance reservations, you can even
              use the LiveCoupon immediately! After all, eating is an impulsive
              decision, right?
